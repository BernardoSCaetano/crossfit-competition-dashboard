## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap & Next Actions

Short-term (Frontend):

- Athlete search improvements (filter by category/team; deep link via query params)
- WOD tables per category (display scoring type, caps, tie-breaks)
- WOD releases schedule module with countdowns
- Share Card generator (PNG export) for Athlete/WOD results with CFBE branding/hashtag

Data & Back-end Options (to capture real athlete performances):

- Option A: Google Sheets + API gateway (quick, low ops)
  - Use a single Google Sheet for athletes, teams, scores
  - Lightweight proxy (Cloud Functions/Vercel Functions) to read/write
- Option B: Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage)
  - Tables: athletes, teams, wods, scores, categories, movements
  - Row Level Security to protect edits; simple admin UI
- Option C: Vercel Postgres or Neon + Prisma
  - Fits existing Vercel pipeline; type-safe schema migrations
- Option D: Airtable (no-code friendly, quick admin)

Recommended starting point: Supabase (fast to stand up, free tier, SQL-based, good auth). Alternative: Google Sheets if you prefer ‚Äúspreadsheet-first‚Äù workflows.

Environment variables (Vercel / local .env):

```bash
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
# For serverless write routes (later): SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...
```

Apply schema (in Supabase SQL editor):

```sql
-- See supabase/schema.sql in repo for full version
```

Initial Data Model (minimal):

- athletes(id, name, email, category, team_id)
- teams(id, name, type)
- wods(id, name, description, scoring_type, cap_seconds)
- scores(id, athlete_id, wod_id, score_value, rank, notes, created_at)
- categories(key, name, notes)

Roles & Flows:

- Admin panel (protected) to manage athletes, teams, WOD definitions
- Judge entry form (mobile-friendly) to submit scores quickly
- Public read endpoints/pages for leaderboard and athlete pages

Delivery Plan:

1. Stand up Supabase project + tables + service keys (or choose Option A/D)
2. Add lightweight API routes (Vercel Functions) for scores/athletes CRUD
3. Swap mock data for live API in Dashboard, Athletes, and WOD pages
4. Add Admin/Judge views guarded by simple auth (one-time magic links or password)
5. Implement Share Card export (html-to-image or html2canvas)

If you prefer a no-backend start, I can wire Google Sheets now and migrate later with minimal changes.
